Teams employed multiple strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs (expected to offset the vast majority of exposure) , such as diversifying country of production, evolving the assortment (e.g., Bullseye's Playground) , negotiating with vendors , and keeping price increases as a last resort. 3. Strong expense control and cost discipline drove SG&A dollars lower in Q2 , and major one-time tariff costs (like order cancellation costs) were mostly incurred in Q2.",TGT,H1-2025,Medium
